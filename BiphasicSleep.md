# The Lost Art of Biphasic Sleep: How Humanity Once Slept Twice Per Night

For millennia, people slept in two shifts – once in the evening, and once in the morning. But why? And how did the habit disappear?

## A 17th-Century Mystery

It was around 23:00 on 13 April 1699, in a small village in the north of England. Nine-year-old **Jane Rowth** blinked her eyes open and squinted out into the moody evening shadows. She and her mother had just awoken from a short sleep.

Mrs Rowth got up and went over to the fireside of their modest home, where she began smoking a pipe. Just then, two men appeared by the window. They called out and instructed her to get ready to go with them.

As Jane later explained to a courtroom, her mother had evidently been expecting the visitors. She went with them freely – but first whispered to her daughter to "lye still, and shee would come againe in the morning." Perhaps Mrs Rowth had some nocturnal task to complete. Or maybe she was in trouble, and knew that leaving the house was a risk.

Either way, Jane's mother never returned home. That night, **Mrs Rowth was brutally murdered**, and her body was discovered in the following days. The crime was never solved.

## Roger Ekirch’s Discovery

Nearly 300 years later, in the early 1990s, historian **Roger Ekirch** walked into the Public Record Office in London (the former UK National Archives) and found Jane’s testimony. Something about it struck him as odd.

Originally, Ekirch had been researching the history of night-time. When reading through records, he stumbled upon a phrase that would change sleep history forever:  
> “First sleep.”

In her testimony, Jane casually mentioned that she and her mother had arisen from their *first sleep* of the evening. There was no further explanation — it was stated as if it were entirely normal. A first sleep implies a second sleep — a night divided into two halves.

Was this just a family quirk, or something universal?

## An Ancient Pattern

Over the following months, Ekirch scoured archives and found many more references to this mysterious phenomenon — **double sleeping**, or *biphasic sleep*, as he called it.

He found mentions of two sleeps:

- In *The Canterbury Tales* by Geoffrey Chaucer (1387–1400).  
- In William Baldwin’s *Beware the Cat* (1561).  
- In letters, diaries, medical texts, newspaper articles, and plays.

Even in popular songs of the time:

> “And at the wakening of your first sleepe, you shall have a hot drink made,  
> And at the wakening of your next sleepe, your sorrows will have a slake.”

The practice wasn’t unique to England. In France it was called *le premier somme*, in Italy *il primo sonno*. Records exist from **Africa, Asia, South America, and the Middle East**.

## How Biphasic Sleep Worked

A 17th-century night went something like this:

1. People went to bed between 21:00 and 23:00.  
2. They slept for a couple of hours — their *first sleep*.  
3. Between roughly 23:00 and 01:00 they awoke naturally. This period was called **“the watch”**.  
4. They used this time to:
   - Add logs to the fire  
   - Pray or meditate  
   - Mend clothing or perform chores  
   - Talk or have sex  
   - Or simply think under the soft glow of moonlight or a rush-light candle  
5. After an hour or two, they returned for their **second sleep** until dawn.

Communal beds were common — filled with family, strangers, or servants — and the watch provided a rare moment of privacy and reflection.

## Ancient and Natural Roots

Ekirch found references to two-phase sleeping across antiquity:

- Plutarch, Pausanias, Livy, and Virgil all described interrupted sleep.  
- Early Christians embraced the midnight watch for prayer.  
- Saint Benedict ordered monks to rise at midnight for psalms — a practice that spread widely.

Many **animals** also sleep in segmented cycles. The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, is *cathemeral* — active by both day and night. This pattern may mirror our own evolutionary rhythm.

## Modern Experiments

In 1993, the scientist **Thomas Wehr** conducted a controlled experiment at the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health. Fifteen men were deprived of artificial light, living with 10-hour “days” and 14-hour “nights.”

At first, they slept continuously. But after several weeks, their sleep naturally divided into **two blocks**, separated by one to three hours of wakefulness. Their melatonin levels adapted accordingly.

Biphasic sleep had re-emerged under natural conditions — confirming Ekirch’s historical findings.

## A Living Tradition

In 2015, sleep scientist **David Samson** and collaborators studied villagers in **Manadena, Madagascar**, where there is no electric lighting. Using sleep trackers, they found that participants:
- Slept after sunset,
- Awoke briefly after midnight,
- Then returned to sleep until dawn.

Biphasic sleep still survives in regions untouched by industrial lighting.

## The Industrial Revolution and the Death of “First Sleep”

Ekirch traced the disappearance of biphasic sleep to the 19th century. The **Industrial Revolution** introduced gas lamps, and later electric lighting, allowing people to stay up later — but not sleep later.

Sleep became compressed into one long block. Over decades, the *second sleep* faded entirely from cultural memory.

Samson’s later work in Madagascar tested this, using artificial lighting for one week — the difference was minimal, suggesting that the full transition took generations.

## The Psychology of Insomnia

Modern humans often panic when they wake up at night, assuming something is wrong. Ekirch suggests that such **middle-of-the-night wakefulness** might be a harmless echo of ancient biphasic rest.

Learning that two-phase sleep was once normal can reduce anxiety for insomniacs — our sleep anxiety may simply reflect a mismatch between biology and social expectation.

---

## A Golden Age of Sleep

Despite nostalgia for the “natural” sleep of the past, Ekirch emphasizes that our modern beds, hygiene, and safety make this a **“golden age” for sleep**. We no longer share beds with strangers or fear being murdered or frozen in our sleep.

Our single, continuous sleeping pattern may not be *natural* — but it is *comfortable*. Conditions have changed, and there’s no going back.

We may miss our midnight musings, vivid dreams, and whispered conversations in the dark —  
but at least we can wake up without the fleas.

## Modern Experiment: Natural Segmented Biphasic Sleep

Recreate preindustrial conditions to naturally induce the article's biphasic pattern—two nighttime sleeps ("first sleep" and "second sleep") separated by 1-3 hours of wakefulness ("the watch"). Thomas Wehr's 1990s experiments proved this emerges organically in extended darkness, without rigid schedules.

### Core Method

Align with sunlight; adaptation takes 2-4 weeks as circadian rhythms shift.

1. **Sun-Based Bedtime**: Go to bed ~1 hour after sunset (e.g., winter CET ~17:00 sunset → ~18:00 bed; summer ~21:00 → ~22:00). Lie in total darkness until sleepy (initially 1-2 hours latency).
2. **Extended Darkness**: Maintain 12-14 hours blackout nightly—use blackout curtains, eye mask, earplugs. No lights, windows, or screens.
3. **Natural Flow**:
    - **First sleep**: 3-4 hours (emerges naturally).
    - **The watch**: 1-3 hours awake (use for prayer, Bible reading by red light, journaling, or quiet reflection—no chores/screens).
    - **Second sleep**: 3-4 hours until dawn wake.
4. **Daytime Anchors**: Morning sunlight exposure; no caffeine after noon; light dinner 2-3h pre-bed.
5. **Consistency**: Same approach daily (including weekends) for 4 weeks minimum.

**Expected Pattern After Adaptation** (total 7-9 hours):

```
Sunset+1h → First sleep (~4h) → Watch (1-3h) → Second sleep (~4h) → Dawn wake
```


### Tracking Progress

Use a simple journal:

```
Date | Bedtime | First sleep end | Watch duration | Second sleep end | Total sleep | Daytime energy (1-10) | Notes
```


### Benefits from Experiments

- Effortless rhythm once adapted (like Wehr's subjects).
- Calm, productive "watch" time (historical prayer/philosophy).
- More REM sleep, vivid dreams, reduced insomnia anxiety.


### Practical Tips

- **Environment**: Cool room (16-18°C); comfortable bedding.
- **Watch Activities**: Low-stimulation only—extend spiritual routine, light reading, or sentinel-like reflection.
- **Light Pollution Fix**: Strict blackout if urban; timer plugs for lights.


### Caveats

Initial fatigue/insomnia (weeks 1-2); requires evening flexibility. Ensure 7-9 total hours or risk deprivation. Not medically proven superior long-term—monitor health, stop if unrested. Consult doctor for sleep disorders.
